Update a distributed firewall rule in a layer 3 section.

* Retrieve the configuration for the section that contains the rule you want
  to modify.
* Retrieve the Etag value from the response headers.
  **Note**: This is the Etag value of the firewall section to which you want
  to add the rule. If you are keeping this rule in the same section, you must
  keep the same Etag number.
* Extract and modify the rule configuration from the response body as needed.
* Set the If-Match header to the section Etag value, and submit the request.

Not all fields are required while sending the request. All the optional fields
are safe to be ignored while sending the configuration to server. For example,
if an IP set is referenced in the rule only IPSet and Type is needed in the
Source/Destination objects and not Name and isValid tags.

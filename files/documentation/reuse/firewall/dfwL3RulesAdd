Add rules to the specified layer 3 section in distributed firewall.

You add firewall rules at the global scope. You can then narrow down the scope
(datacenter, cluster, distributed virtual port group, network, virtual machine,
vNIC, or logical switch) at which you want to apply the rule. Firewall allows
you to add multiple objects at the source and destination levels for each rule,
which helps reduce the total number of firewall rules to be added.  To add a
identity based firewall rule, first create a security group based on Directory
Group objects. Then create a firewall rule with the security group as the
source or destination.  Rules that direct traffic to a third part service are
referred to as layer3 redirect rules, and are displayed in the layer3 redirect
tab.

When Distributed Firewall is used with Service Composer, firewall
rules created by Service Composer contain an additional attribute
in the XML called managedBy.

Follow this procedure to add a rule:

* Retrieve the configuration for the specified section.
* Retrieve the Etag value from the response headers.
  **Note**: Each section contains its own Etag, generationNumber, and
  timestamp. When adding a new rule, you must use the Etag value of the
  firewall section to which you wish to add the rule.
* Extract and modify the configuration from the response body as needed.
* Set the If-Match header to the section Etag value, and submit the request.

Not all fields are required while sending the request. All the optional fields
are safe to be ignored while sending the configuration to server. For example,
if an IP set is referenced in the rule only IPSet and Type is needed in the
Source/Destination objects and not Name and isValid tags.

When updating the firewall configuration:

* IDs for new rules should be removed or set to zero.
* If new rules have been sent in the request, the response
  will contain the system-generated IDs, which are assigned to these new
  entities.
* **appliedTo** can be any valid firewall rule element.
* **action** can be *ALLOW*, *BLOCK*, or *REJECT*. REJECT sends reject message for
  unaccepted packets; RST packets are sent for TCP connections and ICMP
  unreachable code packets are sent for UDP, ICMP, and other IP connections
* source and destination can have an exclude flag. For example, if you add an
  exclude tag for 1.1.1.1 in the source parameter, the rule looks for traffic
  originating from all IPs other than 1.1.1.1.

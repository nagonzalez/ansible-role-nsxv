Working With Layer 2 Sections in Distributed Firewall
----

You can use sections in the firewall table to group logical rules based on
AppliedTo or for a tenant use case. A firewall section is the smallest unit of
configuration which can be updated independently. Section types are as
follows:
* Layer3Section contains layer3 rules
* Layer2Section contains layer2 rules
* Layer3RedirectSection contains traffic redirect rules.

When Distributed Firewall is used with Service Composer, firewall sections
created by Service Composer contain an additional attribute in the XML called
managedBy. You should not modify Service Composer firewall sections using
Distributed Firewall REST APIs.

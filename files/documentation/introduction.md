This manual, the *NSX API Guide*, describes how to install, configure, monitor, and maintain the
VMware NSX® Data Center for vSphere® system by using REST API requests.

**Important**: NSX for vSphere is now known as NSX Data Center for vSphere.

## Intended Audience

This manual is intended for anyone who wants to use the REST API to
programmatically control an NSX Data Center for vSphere environment. The information
in this manual is written for experienced developers who are familiar with
virtual machine technology, virtualized datacenter operations, and REST APIs.
This manual also assumes familiarity with NSX Data Center for vSphere.

## Using the NSX REST API

To use the NSX REST API, you must configure a REST client, verify the required
ports are open between your REST client and the NSX Manager, and understand
the general RESTful workflow.

### Ports Required for the NSX REST API

The NSX Manager requires port 443/TCP for REST API requests.

### Configuring REST Clients for the NSX REST API

Some common REST clients include Postman, RESTClient (a Firefox add-on), and
curl (a command-line tool). The details of REST client configuration will vary
from client to client, but this general information should help you configure
your REST client correctly.

* **The NSX REST API can use basic authentication or JSON Web Token authentication.**   
You can authenticate using basic authentication or JSON Web Tokens. See "Working
with API Tokens" for information on creating and using JSON Web Tokens. You must
configure your REST client to send the NSX Manager authentication credentials.
See the documentation for your REST client for details. 

* **You must use https to send API requests to the NSX Manager.**   
You might need to import the certificate from the NSX Manager to your REST
client to allow it to connect to the NSX Manager.

* **When you submit an API request with a request body, you must include the 
appropriate `Content-Type` header.**   
Starting in NSX 6.4, both XML and JSON are supported. This guide documents XML
examples. Set the **Content-Type** header to *application/xml* or *application/json* as needed.  
Some requests require additional headers, for example, firewall configuration
changes require the **If-Match** header. This is noted on each method
description.
* **To ensure you always receive the correct response bodies, set the `Accept` header**   
Starting in NSX 6.4, both XML and JSON are supported. This guide documents XML
examples. Set the **Accept** header to *application/xml* or *application/json* as
needed.  
**Note:** Some methods, for example, the central CLI method, `POST /1.0/nsx/cli`, might require a different Accept header.

The following API method will return a response on a newly deployed NSX
Manager appliance, even if you have not made any configuration changes. You
can use this as a test to verify that your REST client is configured correctly
to communicate with the NSX Manager API.

```
GET /api/2.0/services/usermgmt/user/admin
```

### URI and Query Parameters

Some methods have URI or query parameters. URI parameters are values that you
include in the request URL. You use a question mark (**?**) to join the request
URL and the query parameters. Multiple query parameters can be combined by
using ampersands (**&**).

For example, you can use this method to get a list of logical switches on a transport zone: 

```
GET /api/2.0/vdn/scopes/{scopeId}/virtualwires
```

**scopeId** is a URI parameter that represents a transport zone.

The **startindex** and **pagesize** query parameters control how this
information is displayed. **startindex** determines which logical switch to
begin the list with, and **pagesize** determines how many logical switches to
list.  

To view the first 20 logical switches on transport zone vdnscope-1, use the following parameters:

* **scopeId** URI parameter set to *vdnscope-1*.  
* **startindex** query parameter set to *0*.   
* **pagesize** query parameter set to *20*.   

These parameters are combined to create this request:

```
GET https://192.168.110.42/api/2.0/vdn/scopes/vdnscope-1/virtualwires?
startindex=0&pagesize=20
```

### RESTful Workflow Patterns

All RESTful workflows fall into a pattern that includes only two fundamental
operations, which you repeat in this order for as long as necessary.

* **Make an HTTP request (GET, PUT, POST, or DELETE).**   
The target of this request is either a well-known URL (such as NSX Manager) or
a link obtained from the response to a previous request. For example, a GET
request to an Org URL returns links to vDC objects contained by the Org.
* **Examine the response, which can be an XML document or an HTTP response code.**   
If the response is an XML document, it might contain links or other
information about the state of an object. If the response is an HTTP response
code, it indicates whether the request succeeded or failed, and might be
accompanied by a URL that points to a location from which additional
information can be retrieved.

### Revision Numbers

Some API objects include a configuration version number. In some cases, this
revision number is used to prevent concurrent changes to an object. As a best
practice, before you change the configuration of an object, retrieve the latest
configuration using GET. Modify the response body as needed and use it as your
PUT request body. If the object has been modified since your GET operation, you
might see an error message.

## Finding vCenter Object IDs

Many API methods reference vCenter object IDs in URI parameters, query
parameters, request bodies, and response bodies. You can find vCenter object
IDs via the vCenter Managed Object Browser.
